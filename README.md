# DEQ - MVP

## Components
1. Optimizer for a building neighborhood
2. Simulation model of biulding neighborhoods model in FMU
3. Communication interface for FIWARE

## Roadmaps
1. Set up the devices in a building neighborhood;
2. Adjust the optimizer to the devices
3. Set up the data model on FIWARE
4. Create the interface between the simulation model and FIWARE
5. Create the interface between the optimizer and FIWARE
